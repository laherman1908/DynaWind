# DynaWind

**DynaWind** is a modular, high-fidelity Python simulation framework for co-simulation of wind turbine dynamics and power systems. It integrates aerodynamic and structural models from OpenFAST (FMU-based) with detailed electrical models of the turbine generator and converters.

## Features

- ⚙️ **Co-simulation with OpenFAST**: FMU integration for high-fidelity turbine dynamics.
- ⚡ **Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM)**: Detailed electric drive modeling including current control.
- 🔋 **DC-link System**: Voltage regulation with chopper logic and anti-windup control.
- 🔌 **Grid-Side Converter (PQ/PV control)**: Integrated with external power system solvers.
- 📈 **Logging and Visualization**: Automated results collection and flexible plotting with Matplotlib and Plotly.
